In GRU.ipynb I built a bidirectional RNN with GRU， the project has followed the standard project procedure I have used in CNN Cifar10. 

In this project I was focusing on getting familiar with data preprocessing for language model， like tranformation from raw data to one hot vector to embedded vector tensor， and make dictionary for mapping indexes to countries，and database class implementation.


The model is made ready to train either on cpu or on cuda

training and test set are available in folder 'data'
