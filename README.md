 基于cifar10 的简单模型，着重于掌握 项目流程的规范化，模型保存，模型读取，以及项目过程内对trainning 进行封装，这些任务完成后可以使得后续训练模型过程中，超参数搜索过程变得更加便利。 
因此也是后续每一个训练模型项目都应当遵循的项目规范


In this simple image classification project ，which based on the cifar10 database , I focused on getting familiar with the standard precedures of the completing a project ,  which including model saving, model reading, and encapsulation of training phase and other phases into a functions . After these tasks are completed, the subsequent  model training process can be  more efficient，then it is easier to keep track of which model and para settings are being used. And it lso makes project/model..optimizer..dataset, etc. less sensitive to changes. Afterall of these, the process of hyper parameters searching has been made more convenient.

Therefore, it is going to pay off in the end if we stick to this precedures in follow up projects
